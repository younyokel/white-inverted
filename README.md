**White Cursor by [1davi](https://www.deviantart.com/1davi/art/White-Cursor-382757360) inverted by [elEscobar](https://www.deviantart.com/elescobar/art/White-Inverted-original-by-1davi-606266139),** but slightly improved just for my personal use.

### The main difference:
- "busy" and "wait" animations are now include one frame hourglass.
- "text" cursor is now thicker.
- "link" cursor is now bigger and does not have three lines on it.

So that is it. I tried to make it more or less like it was designed for old PCs.
